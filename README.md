# 📈 EMA Strategy Backtest on Gold Prices (Excel Project)

This Excel project tests the performance of an EMA-based trading strategy on 90 days of real gold price data. It includes full backtesting with dynamic dashboards for analyzing win/loss ratios, trend-based performance, and session-wise success rates.
